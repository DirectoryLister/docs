# Authentication

Directory Lister does not include any form of authentication out of the box. This is intentional to keep the application focused and easier to maintain. However, there are ways to use external authentication with Directory Lister. The following are some known methods of adding authentication to your application.

## HTTP Basic Authentication

Modern web servers have the ability to restrict access to a directory via a `.htpasswd` file. The way this is configured varies based on the web server in use so you will need to reference the documentation for your web server.

### Apache

* [`mod_auth_basic` documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_auth_basic.html)
* [ `.htpasswd` documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htpasswd.html)&#x20;

### NGINX

* [Basic Authentication documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/security-controls/configuring-http-basic-authentication/)

## Authelia Proxy Authorization

[Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/), the open-source authentication and authorization server, may be used to add authorization to an instance of Directory Lister behind a reverse proxy.
